In rare situations a element may want to change the props of a element that it doesn't own (like changing the `className` of a element passed as `this.props.children`). Other times it may want to make multiple copies of a element passed to it. `cloneWithProps()` makes this possible.

#### `ReactElement React.addons.cloneWithProps(ReactElement element, object? extraProps)`

Do a shallow copy of `element` and merge any props provided by `extraProps`. The `className` and `style` props will be merged intelligently.

> Note:
>
> `cloneWithProps` does not transfer `key` to the cloned element. If you wish to preserve the key, add it to the `extraProps` object:
>
> ```js
> var clonedElement = cloneWithProps(originalElement, { key : originalElement.key });
> ```
>
> `ref` is similarly not preserved.
