Consider this variable declaration:

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React "elements". We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the [next section](/react/docs/rendering-elements.html). Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.

### Embedding Expressions in JSX

You can embed any [JavaScript expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Expressions) in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces.

For example, `2 + 2`, `user.name`, and `formatName(user)` are all valid expressions:

```js{12}
function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[Try it on CodePen.](http://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/PGEjdG?editors=0010)

We wrapped JSX in parentheses and split it over multiple lines for readability. This also helps avoid the pitfalls of [automatic semicolon insertion](http://stackoverflow.com/q/2846283).

### JSX is an Expression Too

After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript objects.

This means that you can use JSX inside of `if` statements and `for` loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:

```js{3,5}
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user.name)}!</h1>;
  } else {
    return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
  }
}
```

### Specifying Attributes with JSX

You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:

```js
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;
```

You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:

```js
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```

### Specifying Children with JSX

If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with `/>`, like XML:

```js
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```

JSX tags may contain children:

```js
const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
);
```

>**Caveat:**
>
>Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than HTML, React DOM uses `camelCase` property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.
>
>For example, `class` becomes [`className`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className) in JSX, and `tabindex` becomes [`tabIndex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/tabIndex).

### JSX Prevents Injection Attacks

It is safe to embed user input in JSX:

```js
const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;
```

By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them.

### JSX Represents Objects

Babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()` calls.

These two examples are identical:

```js
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
```

```js
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

`React.createElement()` performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:

```js
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world'
  }
};
```

These objects are called "React elements". You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.

We will explore rendering React elements to the DOM in the next section.

>**Tip:**

>We recommend searching for a "Babel" syntax scheme for your editor of choice so that both ES6 and JSX code is properly highlighted.
