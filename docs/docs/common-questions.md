### What browsers does React support?

React supports the latest two Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer versions. React can work with Internet Explorer 8 with polyfills.

### How do I get React to support Internet Explorer 8?

React requires ES5 JavaScript shims to run in Internet Explorer 8. Include the [ES5 Shims](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim) to implement these shims.

### Who uses React?

The [Instagram](http://instagram.com/) website is built entirely in React. The [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) website is also increasingly using React, including the common commenting plugin across the site.

### Can I integrate with other JavaScript libraries?

Absolutely! In fact, we encourage it! See [our GitHub repo](http://github.com/facebook/react/) for a [TodoMVC example using Backbone](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/examples/todomvc-backbone) and a [jQuery + Bootstrap modal demo](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/examples/jquery-bootstrap).
