### Problem
You're getting a parsing error from JSX.

### Solution
You might have tried to return more than one node in your component's `render`. Currently, you can only return one node, meaning that you must wrap your components within, say, a `div` or a `span` (or any other component).

### Discussion
Don't forget that JSX compiles into regular js; returning two functions doesn't really make syntactic sense. Likewise, don't put more than one child in a ternary.
