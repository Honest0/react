### Problem
You want to listen to an event inside a component.

### Solution
> Note:
>
> This entry shows how to attach DOM events not provided by React ([check here for more info](/react/docs/cookbook/events.html)). This is good for integrations with other libraries such as jQuery.

This example displays the window width:

```js
/** @jsx React.DOM */

var Box = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {windowWidth: window.innerWidth};
  },
  handleResize: function(e) {
    this.setState({windowWidth: window.innerWidth});
  },
  componentDidMount: function() {
    window.addEventListener("resize", this.handleResize);
  },
  componentWillUnmount: function() {
    window.removeEventListener("resize", this.handleResize);
  },
  render: function() {
    return <div>Current window width: {this.state.windowWidth}</div>;
  }
});

React.renderComponent(<Box />, mountNode);
```

### Discussion
`componentDidMount` is called after the component's mounted and has a DOM representation. This is often a place where you'd attach generic DOM events.
