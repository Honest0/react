### Problem
You're getting a parsing error (unexpected token) from JSX.

### Solution
One of the reasons might be that you didn't put a `/` for your self-closing tags. `<MyComponent />` is valid while `<MyComponent>` isn't.

### Discussion
Every React component can be self-closing where it makes sense: `<div/>`.
