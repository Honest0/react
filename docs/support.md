**React** is worked on full-time by Facebook's product infrastructure and Instagram's user interface engineering teams. They're often around and available for questions.

## Stack Overflow

Many members of the community use Stack Overflow to ask questions. Read through the [existing questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactjs) tagged with **reactjs** or [ask your own](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask)!

## Discussion forum

For longer-form conversations about React, we've set up a [discussion forum at **discuss.reactjs.org**](https://discuss.reactjs.org/). This forum is a great place for discussion about best practices and application architecture as well as the future of React. If you have an answerable code-level question, please post it to Stack Overflow instead.

In the forum there's also a category for job posts and a category for discussion of our weekly meeting notes.
