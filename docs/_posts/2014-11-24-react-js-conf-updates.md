Yesterday, the call for presenters closed for [React.js Conf](http://conf.reactjs.com/) and we couldn't believe it, we got a **hundred proposals** and more than 600 people left their contact information to be notified when tickets would go on sale. This is incredible!

But...

When we organized the conference we decided to start small since it's the first one. We went for a single track, two-days conference, on Facebook campus. This means that we've got "only" 18 speaking slots and 200 attendees.

Unfortunately, we're using the biggest room on campus and putting more people won't make for a very good experience. The spatial configuration also makes it hard to add a second track to accomodate for more speakers. Changing the venue only two months in advance is also going to prove very challenging.

So...

We took the very hard decision of keeping the current format. This means that from the hundred talks that were submitted, we're only going to be able to accept a tiny number :( For the attendees, we want to make sure that people have a fair shot at getting their tickets, so we're going to do three waves of ticket sales. Each of them is going to be first come first serve. **The price is set to $200 per ticket**.

- Friday November 28th 2014 — Noon PST, first wave
- A week later, on Friday December 5th 2014 — Noon PST, second wave
- A week later, on Friday December 12th 2014 — Noon PST, third and last wave

This is a very unfortunate situation but I hope that we can make the best out of it!
