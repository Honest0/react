title: Why Should You Care About React?

There are a lot of JavaScript MVC frameworks out there. Why did we build React
and why would you want to use it?


## React isn't an MVC framework.

It's a library designed for building big UIs. The type where you have lots of
reusable components that are handling events, presenting backend data, and
accepting user input. The type where you have to integrate with legacy code, and
support legacy browsers.

In the traditional MVC pattern, React is used to build the view. React lets you
decide how to manage your data and business logic, be it outside of React
components or within.

## React doesn't use templates.

Traditionally, web application UIs are built using templates written in
templating languages or HTML directives. These templates dictate the full set of
abstractions that you are allowed to use to build the user interface.

React approaches building user interfaces differently by breaking them down into
smaller, composable and reusable **components**. Although this means we have
JavaScript generating markup, we think this is an advantage over templates for a
few reasons:

- **JavaScript is a flexible, powerful programming language with the ability to
  build abstractions.** This is incredibly important in large applications.
- By unifying markup and logic with a common language, applications can
  implement more appropriate separations of concerns.
- Large projects usually do not use WYSIWYG editors for production code, so
  breaking apart markup from code creates friction without any real gain.
- By baking an understanding of markup and content into JavaScript, there's
  **no manual string concatenation** and therefore less surface area for XSS
  vulnerabilities.

## Reactive updates are dead simple.

React really shines when your data changes over time.

In a traditional JavaScript application, you need to look at what data changed
and imperatively make changes to the DOM to keep it up-to-date. Even AngularJS,
which provides a declarative interface via directives and data binding, requires
a linking function to manually update DOM nodes. Remember, React components are
flexible and expressive, much like directives and less like templates in
AngularJS.

React takes a different approach.

When your component is first initialized, the `render()` method is called and a
string of static HTML is inserted into the DOM. When your data changes, the
`render()` method is called again. We simply diff the old return value with the
new one to determine the fastest way to update the DOM. So if only a single
attribute on a single element changes, that's all that React updates.

We call this process **reconciliation**. Check out
[this jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/fv6RD/3/) for an example of reconciliation
in action.

Reconciliation will usually be faster than handwritten code because React knows
about the entire state of the page and can do cool tricks like batching reads
and writes and picking the fastest subset of DOM mutations to perform.

The way we're able to pull this off is by constructing a very fast, lightweight
representation of the DOM which knows which parts are dirtied and which parts
are clean. **The data returned from `render()` is neither a string nor a DOM
node -- it's a lightweight description of what the DOM should look like.**

Because this re-render is so fast (on the order of 1ms for TodoMVC), we don't
need the end user to explicitly specify data bindings. We've found this to be an
easier way to build apps. It's a lot like the early days of the dynamic web.
Back then, you wrote simple presentational code and when your data changed, you
simply refreshed the page. Today, React makes that refresh very fast and
lightweight, and only the parts of markup that need to be changed are changed.

No other framework that we've seen has managed to decouple building UIs without
being coupled with the DOM.

## HTML is just the beginning.

Since React makes very few assumptions about its environment, we can do some
pretty cool things with it:

- Facebook has dynamic charts that render to `<canvas>` instead of HTML.
- Instagram is a "single page" web app built entirely with React and
  `Backbone.Router`. Designers regularly contribute React code with JSX.
- We've built an internal prototype that runs React apps in a web worker.
- You can run React
  [on the server](http://github.com/petehunt/react-server-rendering)
  for SEO, performance, code sharing and overall flexibility.
- Events behave in a consistent, standards-compliant way in all browsers
  (including IE8) and automatically use
  [event delegation](http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate).
