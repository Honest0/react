# react-call-return

This is an experimental package for multi-pass rendering in React.

**Its API is not as stable as that of React, React Native, or React DOM, and does not follow the common versioning scheme.**

**Use it at your own risk.**

# API

See the test case in `src/__tests__/ReactCallReturn.js` for an example.
