# react-call-return

This is an experimental package for multi-pass rendering in React.

**Its API is not as stable as that of React, React Native, or React DOM, and does not follow the common versioning scheme.**

**Use it at your own risk.**

# No, Really, It Is Unstable

This is **an experiment**.

We will replace this with a different API in the future.  
It can break between patch versions of React.

Don't rely on this for anything except experiments.  
Even in experiments, make sure to lock the versions so that an update doesn't break your app.

Don't publish third party components relying on this unless you clearly mark them as experimental too.  
They will break.

Have fun! Let us know if you find interesting use cases for it.

# API

See the test case in `src/__tests__/ReactCallReturn.js` for an example.
