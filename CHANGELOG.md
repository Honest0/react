## 0.8.0 (December 19, 2013)

### React

* Added support for more attributes:
  * `rows` & `cols` for `<textarea>`
  * `defer` & `async` for `<script>`
  * `loop` for `<audio>` & `<video>`
  * `autoCorrect` for form fields (a non-standard attribute only supported by mobile WebKit)
* Improved error messages
* Fixed Selection events in IE11
* Added `onContextMenu` events

### React with Addons

* Fixed bugs with TransitionGroup when children were undefined
* Added support for `onTransition`

### react-tools

* Upgraded `jstransform` and `esprima-fb`

### JSXTransformer

* Added support for use in IE8
* Upgraded browserify, which reduced file size by ~65KB (16KB gzipped)


## 0.5.2, 0.4.2 (December 18, 2013)

### React

* Fixed a potential XSS vulnerability when using user content as a `key`: [CVE-2013-7035](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/OIqxlB2aGfU)


## 0.5.1 (October 29, 2013)

### React

* Fixed bug with `<input type="range">` and selection events.
* Fixed bug with selection and focus.
* Made it possible to unmount components from the document root.
* Fixed bug for `disabled` attribute handling on non-`<input>` elements.

### React with Addons

* Fixed bug with transition and animation event detection.


## 0.5.0 (October 16, 2013)

### React

* Memory usage improvements - reduced allocations in core which will help with GC pauses
* Performance improvements - in addition to speeding things up, we made some tweaks to stay out of slow path code in V8 and Nitro.
* Standardized prop -> DOM attribute process. This previously resulting in additional type checking and overhead as well as confusing cases for users. Now we will always convert your value to a string before inserting it into the DOM.
* Support for Selection events.
* Support for [Composition events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompositionEvent).
* Support for additional DOM properties (`charSet`, `content`, `form`, `httpEquiv`, `rowSpan`, `autoCapitalize`).
* Support for additional SVG properties (`rx`, `ry`).
* Support for using `getInitialState` and `getDefaultProps` in mixins.
* Support mounting into iframes.
* Bug fixes for controlled form components.
* Bug fixes for SVG element creation.
* Added `React.version`.
* Added `React.isValidClass` - Used to determine if a value is a valid component constructor.
* Removed `React.autoBind` - This was deprecated in v0.4 and now properly removed.
* Renamed  `React.unmountAndReleaseReactRootNode` to `React.unmountComponentAtNode`.
* Began laying down work for refined performance analysis.
* Better support for server-side rendering - [react-page](https://github.com/facebook/react-page) has helped improve the stability for server-side rendering.
* Made it possible to use React in environments enforcing a strict [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy). This also makes it possible to use React to build Chrome extensions.

### React with Addons (New!)

* Introduced a separate build with several "addons" which we think can help improve the React experience. We plan to deprecate this in the long-term, instead shipping each as standalone pieces. [Read more in the docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/addons.html).

### JSX

* No longer transform `class` to `className` as part of the transform! This is a breaking change - if you were using `class`, you *must* change this to `className` or your components will be visually broken.
* Added warnings to the in-browser transformer to make it clear it is not intended for production use.
* Improved compatibility for Windows
* Improved support for maintaining line numbers when transforming.


## 0.4.1 (July 26, 2013)

### React

* `setState` callbacks are now executed in the scope of your component.
* `click` events now work on Mobile Safari.
* Prevent a potential error in event handling if `Object.prototype` is extended.
* Don't set DOM attributes to the string `"undefined"` on update when previously defined.
* Improved support for `<iframe>` attributes.
* Added checksums to detect and correct cases where server-side rendering markup mismatches what React expects client-side.

### JSXTransformer

* Improved environment detection so it can be run in a non-browser environment.


## 0.4.0 (July 17, 2013)

### React

* Switch from using `id` attribute to `data-reactid` to track DOM nodes. This allows you to integrate with other JS and CSS libraries more easily.
* Support for more DOM elements and attributes (e.g., `<canvas>`)
* Improved server-side rendering APIs. `React.renderComponentToString(<component>, callback)` allows you to use React on the server and generate markup which can be sent down to the browser.
* `prop` improvements: validation and default values. [Read our blog post for details...](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/07/11/react-v0-4-prop-validation-and-default-values.html)
* Support for the `key` prop, which allows for finer control over reconciliation. [Read the docs for details...](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html)
* Removed `React.autoBind`. [Read our blog post for details...](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/07/02/react-v0-4-autobind-by-default.html)
* Improvements to forms. We've written wrappers around `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<option>`, and `<select>` in order to standardize many inconsistencies in browser implementations. This includes support for `defaultValue`, and improved implementation of the `onChange` event, and circuit completion. [Read the docs for details...](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html)
* We've implemented an improved synthetic event system that conforms to the W3C spec.
* Updates to your component are batched now, which may result in a significantly faster re-render of components. `this.setState` now takes an optional callback as it's second parameter. If you were using `onClick={this.setState.bind(this, state)}` previously, you'll want to make sure you add a third parameter so that the event is not treated as the callback.

### JSX

* Support for comment nodes `<div>{/* this is a comment and won't be rendered */}</div>`
* Children are now transformed directly into arguments instead of being wrapped in an array
  E.g. `<div><Component1/><Component2/></div>` is transformed into `React.DOM.div(null, Component1(null), Component2(null))`.
  Previously this would be transformed into `React.DOM.div(null, [Component1(null), Component2(null)])`.
  If you were using React without JSX previously, your code should still work.

### react-tools

* Fixed a number of bugs when transforming directories
* No longer re-write `require()`s to be relative unless specified


## 0.3.3 (June 20, 2013)

### React

* Allow reusing the same DOM node to render different components. e.g. `React.renderComponent(<div/>, domNode); React.renderComponent(<span/>, domNode);` will work now.

### JSX

* Improved the in-browser transformer so that transformed scripts will execute in the expected scope. The allows components to be defined and used from separate files.

### react-tools

* Upgrade Commoner so `require` statements are no longer relativized when passing through the transformer. This was a feature needed when building React, but doesn't translate well for other consumers of `bin/jsx`.
* Upgraded our dependencies on Commoner and Recast so they use a different directory for their cache.
* Freeze our esprima dependency.


## 0.3.2 (May 31, 2013)

### JSX

* Improved compatability with other coding styles (specifically, multiple assignments with a single `var`).

### react-tools

* Switch from using the browserified build to shipping individual modules. This allows react-tools to be used with [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).


## 0.3.1 (May 30, 2013)

### react-tools

* Fix bug in packaging resulting in broken module.


## 0.3.0 (May 29, 2013)

* Initial public release
