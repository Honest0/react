# React Reconciler Test Fixture

This folder exists for **React contributors** only.
If you use React you don't need to worry about it.

These fixtures are a smoke-screen verification that the built React Reconciler distribution works.

To test, from the project root:
* `yarn build`
* `cd fixtures/reconciler`
* `yarn test`

They should run as part of the CI check.
