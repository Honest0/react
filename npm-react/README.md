# react

An npm package to get you immediate access to [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/),
without also requiring the JSX transformer. This is especially useful for cases where you
want to [`browserify`](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) your module using
`React`.


## Example Usage

```js
var React = require('react');

// You can also access ReactWithAddons.
var React = require('react/addons');
```
