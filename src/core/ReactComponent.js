/**
 * Components are the basic units of composition in React.
 *
 * Every component accepts a set of keyed input parameters known as "props" that
 * are initialized by the constructor. Once a component is mounted, the props
 * can be mutated using `setProps` or `replaceProps`.
 *
 * Every component is capable of the following operations:
 *
 *   `mountComponent`
 *     Initializes the component, renders markup, and registers event listeners.
 *
 *   `receiveComponent`
 *     Updates the rendered DOM nodes to match the given component.
 *
 *   `unmountComponent`
 *     Releases any resources allocated by this component.
 *
 * Components can also be "owned" by other components. Being owned by another
 * component means being constructed by that component. This is different from
 * being the child of a component, which means having a DOM representation that
 * is a child of the DOM representation of that component.
